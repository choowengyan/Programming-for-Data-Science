# Programming for Data Science 

This assignment project allows me to code a Python application that retrieves and combines data from multiple data sources to perform data cleansing, transformation,  visualization and analysis on it. 
 
### In this project: 
1. I am able to use Pandas package to do my codings
2. For each dataset I used, I am able write a Python program that uses a data visualization package such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc to produce useful graphs / charts that explain the data. 
   From here, I am abke to perform:  
    - At least one bar chart 
    - At least one line chart 
    - At least one histogram / pie-chart 
    - At least one scatterplot 
    - At least one boxplot  
 3. I am able to gain deeper insights into the chosen datasets such that I am able to craft a ‘storyline’ and produce an interesting data analysis on it.
